# fire-spectral-indices

This repository consists of a pipeline to generate both burn severity and forest recovery imagery for wildfires :fire: using rgee.

The code was modified from Parks et al. 2018, and therefore, any use of this pipeline should property acknowledge and reference the work of Parks et al. 2018.

This repository requires a google earth engine account, earth engine python API and rgee to be setup in advance. For information on how to do this please refer to:

Users are also required to have the latest version of python installed, found here:

All pipeline dependencies are tracked in `renv/`
